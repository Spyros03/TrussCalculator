TrussCalculator is a programm that calculates the internal forces as also the support forces
of any given truss that is staticcaly determined.

The program has the abilty to create trusses easily through a text UI.
It is also possible to save and load any already created truss also 
has the ability to export the results of the calculation to '.txt' file

In order to calculate the truss the program uses the NumPy library
which contains a gauss elimination method that I used to calculate the truss
also informs whether the given system is ill-contitioned and thus the 
truss is unstable.

This programm was my first experience with OOC and i created it to get some
more knowledge on OOC so it may contain errors.

IMPORTANT!:
IN ORDER TO RUN YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAMM AND RUN THE "trussmain.py" FILE.
THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORKIF YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED THE NUMPY LIBRARY!!!

To install NumPy just type at your command prompt the following command:

pip install numpy
